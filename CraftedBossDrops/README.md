![Splash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/probablykory/valheim-mods/main/CraftedBossDrops/splash.jpg)  
A Valheim mod which adds recipes to craft all boss drops, enabling progression without boss kills.

## Features

Configurable recipes for Hard Antler, Swamp Key, Wishbone, Dragon Tear, Torn Spirit, and "Queen Drop".  The default recipes require a large amount of the summon material plus something else from the respective biome.  Modor, Yagluth and Queen recipes are intentionally annoying.  ðŸ™‚  
In addition to the recipes, this mod patches two small aspects of the game.
  1) Haldor the Trader will recognize your progression as long as you 'know' the gated material.  Ex: Haldor will sell you Ymir Flesh and Thunderstone after you've crafted the Swamp Key.
  2) Hugin the Raven will recognize your progression if you've crafted a Hard Antler, and won't pester you about the Black Forest being dangerous.

## Rationale 

Sometimes I play Valheim without killing bosses, and it's a very relaxing way to enjoy the world without stressing out about raids or finding bosses, etc.  Although it's technically possible to play this way in vanilla, you will eventually hit a hard stop at Modor, because you need his drop to craft in Plains.  Ditto for Mistlands.  This mod provides a straight-forward way to craft every boss drop in the game, so you can play this way without abusing trolls or clipping through gates.

I was thinking about finding more thematic recipes than what's setup currently, things like crafting a key mould and stuffing that into the smelter which will pop out the swamp key.  But for now, these simpler recipes will work.
