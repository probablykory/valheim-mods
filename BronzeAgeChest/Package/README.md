A simple Valheim mod which adds the chest that should be there, one made from bronze, sized between Wood and Iron.  

## Features

![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/probablykory/valheim-mods/main/BronzeAgeChest/showcase.jpg)  

A a distinctive chest that fits into the world of Valheim.  Sized at 3 rows, 5 columns.  Build recipe is configurable, but by default costs 15x Wood, 1x Bronze, and 10x Bronze nails.

## Rationale 

I really enjoy bronze age in Valheim, but I hate fighting with wooden chests; they just don't cut it.  Instead of pushing swamp early to upgrade to reinforced chests, I figured I could make a new bronze age chest, and have a great time exploring and enjoying a new world.  

If you're looking for bigger options, or configurable looks, there are a bunch of other mod options out there.  This one's just to fill the tiny little gap in the vanilla gameplay. ðŸ™‚
