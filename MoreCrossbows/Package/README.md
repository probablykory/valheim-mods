## Rationale 

During my first playthrough of Mistlands, the Arbalest fundamentally changed my experience of the game.  I *love* that thing.  On subsequent playthroughs I found myself wanting progression-appropriate crossbows to compliment the bows.  So I made some ðŸ™‚  

The reasoning behind the Lighting Bolts and Arrows is similar.  I wanted a way to have some fun with Eitr that didn't demand I change armor and weapons.  

Lastly, I added the Area Effect bolts to spice things up a bit, give the mod something fun outside the vanilla experience.

## Installation

> **_NOTE:_**  Users that are upgrading should delete their config file and run the game to let the plugin generate a new one.  Settings can and do change between versions, and old configs may be incompatible.

### Manual

  * Un-zip `MoreCrossbows.dll` to your `/Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.

### Thunderstore (manual install)

  * Go to Settings > Import local mod > Select `MoreCrossbows.zip`.
  * Click "OK/Import local mod" on the pop-up for information.

## Translations

This mod has full support for translations, but at the moment only has values for English & Russian.  If you wish to add a translation, please do the following:  
 1.  Copy the json file located at `$your_valheim_folder/BepInEx/plugins/MoreCrossbows/Translations/English/english.json` into a new directory within `Translations`
 2.  Name that directory the same as the language you wish to translate (refer to this [list](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/localization/language-list.html) of languages; the name must be exact).
 3.  Change the values for all the json keys to what they should be.
 
 Now when you run Valheim, it should see the translations automatically.  Lastly, consider sending me the json file (via an issue on [github](https://github.com/probablykory/valheim-mods) or on discord).  I'd like to add as many translations as I can. ðŸ™‚
