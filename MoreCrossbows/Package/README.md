## Rationale 

During my first playthrough of Mistlands, the Arbalest fundamentally changed my experience of the game.  I *love* that thing.  On subsequent playthroughs I found myself wanting progression-appropriate crossbows to compliment the bows.  So I made some ðŸ™‚  

The reasoning behind the Lighting Bolts and Arrows is similar.  I wanted a way to have some fun with Eitr that didn't demand I change armor and weapons.
